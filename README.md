# Road-to-CySa+-Comptia-Cybersecurity-Analyst

Week 1 has consisted of mostly prep work including create this journal.

Finding the right course - decided  to do CySA+ Comptia Cybersecurity Analyst as I have got free learning material through my employer via Stackskills

I watched the introduction video - (3.17 minutes )have broken down the course material by content and video time 

Content
1. Threat Management (150 min)
2. Vulnerability Management (260min)
3. Cyber Incident Response (111min)
4. Security Architecture (67)

Total  video 588min

Roughly 10 hours of video material - 

Break down

1 hour of videos a week and 1 - 2 weeks of exam prep I plan to carry out the exam in june and have CySA+ certificate. :)

I have chosen this course as understand the needs and requirements of cyber security in my workplace and I general interest in all security aspects.

I have been in the electronic security industry for 17 years and have seen the industry go from analog to digital and the sudden need for cyber security.
