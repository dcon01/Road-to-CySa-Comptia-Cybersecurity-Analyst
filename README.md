# CP 3402

Week 1 has consisted of mostly prep work including create this journal \ blog.

Finding the right course - decided  to do CySA+ Comptia Cybersecurity Analyst as I have got free learning material through my employer via Stackskills

I watched the introduction video - (3.17 minutes )have broken down the course material by content and video time 

Content
1. Threat Management (150 min)
2. Vulnerability Management (260min)
3. Cyber Incident Response (111min)
4. Security Architecture (67)

Total  video 588min

Roughly 10 hours of video material - 

Break down

1 hour of videos a week + 30 minutes of my own research and or prep work (I've decided to carry this out on tuesday evening) and 1 - 2 weeks of exam prep I plan to carry out the exam in june and have CySA+ certificate. :)

I have chosen this course as understand the needs and requirements of cyber security in my workplace and I general interest in all security aspects.

I have been in the electronic security industry for 17 years and have seen the industry go from analog to digital and the sudden need for cyber security.


Week 2

I carried an hour of CySA+ Comptia Cybersecurity Analyst program.

I created a very basic Joomla site, I struggled to get my head around the content, perticularly the templates, I could not find a place to creat my own basic template, I ended up using a template from L theme, which I found had too much information on it and created a lot of redundant parts to the site.

I also used a number of templates this seemed to break the hexultimate plugin, aftewr some time of fault finding I unntalled the plugin and installed it again and the templates I downloaded would work,

Error: Call to undefined method HelixUltimate::getRelatedArticles()
I would like to spend some more time working out the templates.
I created a menu with 3 menu items and links to 3 articles. I tested the links and everything was working as should,
I disaaun published  all the modules that were not required although I could still visably see them when I preview my site, I will need spend more time working out how ths feature works
